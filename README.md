# The Odin Project - Rock Paper Scissors game

## Description
This is an exercise from [The Odin Project's Foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths).
In this mini-project, I had to develop a Rock Paper Scissors game. This game is playable in the web console.

## Skills involved
- HTML
- JavaScript
- Git

## Difficulties encountered
The main difficulty I encountered was to reset the computer selection between each round. I spent a lot of time wondering and trying several options but I couldn't find out how. At the end, I realized I didn't reset the index and I kept reassigning the same value to the one I used.
